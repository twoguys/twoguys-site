    %p
      After building a number of iPhone apps we realized we had no way of knowing if users were seeing
      crashes of any sort. There were numerous services available at the time for Ruby on Rails apps,
      but none for iOS, so we decided to build one.
    %p 
      Not long after Crashbucket was launched,
      %a{:href => "http://thoughtbot.com"} Thoughtbot
      contacted us about a possible collaboration. Since we love Thoughtbot and their products we
      were happy to partner with them and integrate Crashbucket into their
      %a{:href => "http://hoptoadapp.com/pages/ios-notifier"} Hoptoad iOS Notifier.

      David did the design and web development. Marshall helped build the iOS notifier library with Caleb Davenport.
