  %p
    The guys at
    %a{:href => "http://fastcustomer.com"} Fastcustomer
    had a great idea to let technology navigate company hold lines and touch-tone menus for you.
    Their app calls you back once they have an operator on the line so you don't have to wait.
  %p
    They asked us to design their marketing web app and to design and build them an easy-to-use
    iPhone app with the least number of steps.
